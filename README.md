# RDF Generator & Ontology Manager (JavaFX + Apache Jena)

A JavaFX desktop application for managing RDF files and ontologies. Built with Apache Jena for RDF parsing, reasoning, querying, and TDB2 storage. Comes with a modular UI, SPARQL console, SHACL validation, and upcoming graph visualization support.

---

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality (Current)
- **RDF / OWL Handling**: Load, view, edit, and save ontologies using Apache Jena (RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples).
- **Persistent Storage**: Local triple store powered by Jena TDB2 for project workspaces.
- **SPARQL Console**: Run SPARQL SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK queries; view results as tables, JSON, or RDF.
- **Reasoning & Validation**: OWL/RDFS inferencing with Jena Reasoners; SHACL validation support using Jena SHACL.
- **Import/Export Tools**: Batch import/export in multiple RDF formats; GraphML/GEXF export for external graph tools.

### Upcoming Enhancements
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**  
  - Embed **Cytoscape.js** (via JavaFX `WebView`) or native tools like **GraphStream** or **JGraphX** to render RDF as interactive graphs (nodes and edges).
  - Enable functionalities like subgraph filtering, expand-on-click, pathfinding, and community detection.
- **Property-Graph Integration (Optional)**  
  - Export RDF to **Neo4j** with **neosemantics (n10s)** or other LPG systems (Gremlin/TinkerPop) for advanced graph analytics using Cypher or Gremlin.
- **Graph Algorithms & Analytics**  
  - Run PageRank, centrality, community detection via Jena + NetworkX or Neo4j GDS.
  - Optionally support GNN-based analytics using PyTorch Geometric or DGL‚Äîbring predictions back as RDF annotations.
- **Enhanced UX**  
  - Dockable UI panes, dark/light themes, smart autocomplete with prefix support, ‚Äúwhy-inferred‚Äù reasoning overlays, and ‚Äúfind usages‚Äù navigation.
- **Testing & CI/CD**  
  - JUnit 5 tests, golden-file RDF round-trip validation.
  - CI builds using GitHub Actions with native installers via `jpackage` for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üó∫ Project Roadmap

Project Storage Enhancements

Add TDB2-backed project management for multiple ontology workspaces.

Validation & Reasoning Panel

UI for SHACL validation results, inference toggles, and editing suggestions.

Graph Visualization

SPARQL CONSTRUCT ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí Cytoscape.js visualization with interactive layout and filtering.

Property-Graph Export (Optional)

RDF ‚Üí LPG using Neo4j + n10s or Gremlin pipelines for alternative views and analytics.

Graph Analytics

Embed GDS algorithms (e.g., PageRank) and display results as node properties within the RDF graph.

Advanced Insights (Phase 2)

Leverage GNNs for link prediction or classification; integrate results back into RDF with provenance.
